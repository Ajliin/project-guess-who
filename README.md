# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Create my own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who? Focus as much as possible on the JavaScript part.

## The problem
My approach is:
1 - understanding the code which is already there
2 - Make a list of what you want to happen, without using code
3 - start with no 1 on the list, try to solve problem and CONSOLE.LOG a lot

I learned some new technologies for me: forEach, arrays, objects, includes, animation

If I hade more time I would do some more styling, especially on the dropdown menu, because it is difficult to use on a phone
